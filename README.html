<h1>SurfaceReconstructionLibrary</h1>

<p>The Surface Reconstruction Library provides functionality for
reconstruction of open or watertight surfaces from a set of 1D
contours representing the intersection of the 3D surface with 2D slice
planes. The reconstruction subproblems of correspondence, branching,
and surface fitting are solved. The surfaces fit by the library are of
minimal surface area. Contained is a set of C functions meant to be
compiled into a shared library.</p>
